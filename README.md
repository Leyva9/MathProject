# Polynomial Root Finder using Bisection Method (C#)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Polynomial Root Finder project! This C# program utilizes the bisection method and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem to find real roots of odd polynomials. This algorithm is particularly useful for finding numerical solutions to algebraic equations when analytical solutions are not readily available.

### Method Description

The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm based on the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that if a continuous function has opposite signs at two points within an interval, there must be at least one root in that interval. The algorithm repeatedly divides the interval in half and checks in which subinterval the root lies.
