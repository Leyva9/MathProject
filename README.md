# Polynomial Root Finder using Bisection Method (C#)

This project is an implementation in **C#** of a program that utilizes the **bisection method** and the **Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem** to find the real roots of any **odd polynomial**. This algorithm is useful for finding numerical solutions to algebraic equations, especially when an analytical solution is not readily available.

## Method Description

The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm based on the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that if a continuous function $f(x)$ has opposite signs at two points $a$ and $b$ in the interval $[a, b]$, then there must be at least one root in that interval. The algorithm repeatedly divides the interval in half and checks in which subinterval the root lies.
